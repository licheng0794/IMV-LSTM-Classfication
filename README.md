# IMV-LSTM-Classfication
It is the  implementation of the interpretable LSTM for classification. The code is the modified version of the implemention https://github.com/KurochkinAlexey/IMV_LSTM, where only the regression is available.

The interpretable LSTM is referred in "Exploring Interpretable LSTM Neural Networks over Multi-Variable Data" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12034.pdf

The dataset is OULAD and the extracted data has been used directly
